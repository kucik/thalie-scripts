    User defined event: Alarm!
************************* [History] ********************************************
    1.3 - Example of User Defined Event
************************* [Workings] *******************************************
    The NPC runs this as a pre-event On Heartbeat.

    Of course, this does't fire if they are fleeing or doing something like that.

    What happens, is that if the ALARM variable, set in the current area the NPC
    is in, is TRUE, then they will pre-buff themselves, arm weapons (if not already)
    and has a 50% chance of ActionRandomWalk.

    If it does the above, it stops the rest of the heartbeat firing.
